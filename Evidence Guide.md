## Design Process and Prototyping
I decided to make my website about reviewing books.

To get inspiration for my user interface I used the imdb website specifically the pages on specific movies to model my website off.

![Html Dune as example of a movie on imdb](https://github.com/Random-Devil-with-internet/Year-12-3-Assignment/blob/main/Dune.png)

The page consists of the title, year of publucation and rating. Below that there is a poster image of the movie with a breif discription of it. And also a spepret page for the reviews.
