## Design Process and Prototyping
I decided to make my website about reviewing books.

To get inspiration for my user interface I used the imdb website specifically the pages on a specific movie to model my website off.

Dune as an example of a movie on imdb
![Html Dune as example of a movie on imdb](https://github.com/Random-Devil-with-internet/Year-12-3-Assignment/blob/main/Dune.png)

The page consists of the title, year of publication and rating. Below that there is a poster image of the movie with a brief description of it. And this is also a separate page for the user reviews.

So for my user interface I decided to put the title and average star rating on the top. With the author, genre and publishing date just below. The description and the cover image side by side. Why this design is becauce the two most imprtant elements of the page which are the description and the cover image placed in the centre to get the mopst attention form the users.
