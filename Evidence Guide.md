## Design Process and Prototyping
I decided to make my website about reviewing books.

To get inspiration for my user interface I used the imdb website specifically the pages on a specific movie to model my website off.

Dune as an example of a movie on imdb

The page consists of the title, year of publication and rating. Below that there is a poster image of the movie with a brief description of it. And this is also a separate page for the user reviews.

So for my user interface I decided to put the title and average star rating on the top. With the author, genre and publishing date just below. The description and the cover image side by side. Why this design is because the two most important elements of the page are the description and the cover image. Which are placed in the centre to get the most attention form the users and since they take up the most space. While the title and the average star rating are the first elements that the user sees when they open the page. To set what the page is going to be about.

The yellow stars in contrast with the grey stars help the users to distinguish between them two. Plus the yellows are made extra dark to help the user contrast them with the background. I also added half stars to allow users to make a more precise rating. For the review section the reviews are listed below in order form when they were made. The review layout consists of the review header. Which has a title paired with the user profile picture, date of publication and the rating of the respective book just below. The main body of text of the review is in the centre since it is the most important element in the review layout.
